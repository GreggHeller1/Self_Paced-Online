# Write some functions that take a sequence as an argument, and return a copy of that sequence:
# (1) with the first and last items exchanged.
# (2) with every other item removed.
# (3) with the first 4 and the last 4 items removed, and then every other item in between.
# (4) with the elements reversed (just with slicing).
# (5) with the middle third, then last third, then the first third in the new order.
